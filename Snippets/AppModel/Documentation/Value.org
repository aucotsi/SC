#+TITLE: Value: AppModel v 2 redo discussion
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil, toc:nil

Redo of Adapter idea from scratch, with radical simplification of principle 

In AppModel2, the Value class will take the place of the Adapter class from AppModel. 

Widget takes the place of AppView.

* Considerations

** Simplify Notification - Response Mechanism

Simplify the notification - response mechanism to avoid having to check argument usage and order for each different subclass or case. Principle: 

- When Widget calls some message on the Value's adapter 

** Generalized widget actions and adapters

Can we have generalized widgets with many actions in response to many notifiers, added
in Event or IdentityDictionary? 

The same holds for the side of Value: Use some specialized adapters such as SpecAdapter2 or 
TextAdapter or even ListAdapter, but also work out a generalized adapter where many notifications and many messages can be added for many values.
